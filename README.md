## Overview

This is my solution to a challenge on frontendMentor.io with the title "interactive rating component". It's tagged a "newbie" challenge category to help sharpen one's Html, CSS and JavaScript skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

One of the things I like about this challenge is that it's my first practice of Javascript (outside tutorial challenges).
I had to think deeply to get somethings working like changing the background color of the clicked button and removing it (from the previous one) when a new button is clicked.
I'll say it's worth the time and effort and happy to see myself get it solved.

### Continued development

All I want to focus on, furthermore, are bestpractices and how I can write code efficiently within a short period of time.
